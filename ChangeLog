	Dingo 0.5.1
	
	This release is basically a bugs-fixing release after the
	first official release of Dingo Media Manager. Here are 
	the changes in this version:
	
	- "Repeat Off" will play the next track after finishing the
	current track instead of stopping completely.
	
	- Navigate to home will make Dingo come back to the current
	playlist, instead of "All Tracks". This fixes the error when
	user navigates to a particular playlist and then play
	a video but when coming back the playlist is set to the main
	playlist.
	
	- The "Manage Tracks' Membership" window will update the
	track-count in each playlist if there is some changes in 
	the number of tracks in the playlist.
	
	- On Fedora: If there is no track in a playlist and 
	"Play" button is clicked, the empty notification will no 
	longer appear.
