Dingo 0.5.1 - 2013-01-04 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author/Maintainer: Phong V. Cao <phongvcao@phongvcao.com>
=====================================================================================

    Dingo 0.5.1 is a bugs-fixing release after Dingo 0.5.0, 
    the first official release of Dingo Media Manager
	
    Dingo is the result of more than 1 year and 6 months of work
    by Phong V. Cao <phongvcao@phongvcao.com> and authors and 
    contributors of various Dingo's dependecies.
    
    Changes in this version:
    - "Repeat Off" will play the next track after finishing the
      current track instead of stopping completely.
    - Navigate to home will make Dingo come back to the current
      playlist, instead of "All Tracks". This fixes the error when
      user navigates to a particular playlist and then play
      a video but when coming back the playlist is set to the main
      playlist.
    - The "Manage Tracks' Membership" window will update the
      track-count in each playlist if there is some changes in 
      the number of tracks in the playlist.
    - On Fedora: If there is no track in a playlist and 
      "Play" button is clicked, the empty notification will no 
      longer appear.
    - Fixed Track Comment not being saved by "Edit Single Track"
    - Fixed highlighting error happening when the current playing
      song is edited and the changed metadata is either track number,
      title, artist, album, or year. 
    
    Notable New Features:
    - Manage and filter both audios and videos
    - Massive tracks - playlists membership management
    - Multiple tracks info editing
    - Repeat section
    - Smart Shuffle
    - Lyrics fetching (offline)
    - TrayIcon with MiniPlayer
